# ismir2020-shared-structure
Companion code for *A Method for Analysis of Shared Structure in Large Music Collections using Techniques from Genetic Sequencing and Graph Theory*

Clone repository and run `npm install`. After updating the code so that it points to your local copy of the dataset ([fifteen-songs-dataset](https://github.com/grateful-dead-live/fifteen-songs-dataset)), run `npm start`.

Alignment and graph manipulation code can be found in packages [musical-structure](https://github.com/florianthalmann/musical-structure) and [msa](https://github.com/florianthalmann/msa).

We're also working on a new implementation in Python/Numpy which will be linked from here as soon as it's done.
